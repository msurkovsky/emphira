* Questions

** Can I detect something like lattice and use a fixed point to detect where to stop with increasing #procs?

** How is it with types, does receives and sends care about data?
For example, Aislinn doesn't care.

* Examples
** a
An easy example where the zeroth process send a data to the first one.
For 2,3,... number of processes the program is correct.
+For only one process the program is incorrect.+
** b
Similar as 'a' but enclosed inside a cycle.
** c
Communication enclosed also inside cycle, nevertheless now it is dependent on
cycle value.
** c-f1
Well this one is slightly modified and results in deadlock
